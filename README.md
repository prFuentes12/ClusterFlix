# ClusterFlix
ClusterFlix is a recommendation system that uses K-Means clustering to group similar users or series based on their preferences or features. By analyzing viewing patterns and ratings, it suggests the most relevant and highly-rated content within each cluster, helping users discover shows they'll likely enjoy, the project performs the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Downloads and organizes the necessary files for analysis.
2. **User-Movie Matrix Creation**: Filters popular movies and creates a rating matrix containing user ratings for each movie.
3. **KMeans Clustering**: Uses the **KMeans** clustering algorithm to group users based on their movie preferences.
4. **Cluster Visualization**: Reduces data dimensionality using **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** and visualizes the user clusters in a 2D space.
5. **Personalized Recommendation**: For a given user, generates movie recommendations based on the average ratings of movies within their cluster.

This project is ideal for exploring clustering techniques and recommendation systems in the context of movie and user data.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **KaggleHub**: To download the MovieLens dataset from Kaggle.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For applying the KMeans algorithm, data standardization (StandardScaler), and PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the clusters and the Elbow Method plot.
- **Shutil**: For moving downloaded files to the correct directory.

## Future Use

This project can be extended in various ways:

- **Improved Recommendation System**: You can refine the recommendation algorithm by incorporating additional data, such as movie genres or user demographics.
- **Real-Time User Data**: Integrating real-time data collection from users could allow the system to update recommendations and clusters dynamically.
- **Alternative Clustering Techniques**: Exploring other clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, or even deep learning-based methods could improve cluster quality.
- **User Interface**: Creating a web interface or a simple app where users can interact with the system, input their preferences, and get recommendations.

By expanding and enhancing this system, it can evolve into a robust recommendation engine for movie streaming platforms or other content-based services.
